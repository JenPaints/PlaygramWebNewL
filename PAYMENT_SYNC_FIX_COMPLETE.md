# Payment Sync Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Identified
Payments made in the student dashboard for enrollment and merchandise were not being updated in the admin dashboard and Convex database due to:

1. **Merchandise View**: Mock data with non-functional "Buy Now" buttons
2. **Missing Payment Integration**: No connection between merchandise purchases and payment tracking
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Only showing enrollment payments, missing merchandise payments

## Key Features Added

### Student Dashboard - Merchandise View
```typescript
// Real-time merchandise data
const merchandise = useQuery(api.merchandise.getActiveMerchandise) || [];
const categories = useQuery(api.merchandise.getCategories) || [];

// Shopping cart with payment processing
const handleCheckout = async () => {
  const { orderId, orderNumber } = await createOrder(orderData);
  await merchandisePaymentService.processPayment(orderId, orderNumber, cartTotal, customerName, customerPhone);
};
```

### Admin Dashboard - Enhanced Tracking
```typescript
// Multiple data sources
const merchandiseOrders = useQuery(api.merchandiseOrders.getAllOrders, {});
const allPayments = useQuery(api.paymentTracking.getAllPaymentRecords, {});

// Unified view with filtering
const filteredAllPayments = allPayments?.filter((payment: any) =>
  !searchPhone || payment.userId.includes(searchPhone)
) || [];
```
