# Text Visibility Fixes

## Problem
Text that should be black/dark was appearing white and blending with white backgrounds, making it invisible or hard to read.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **CSS Variable Conflicts**: The global CSS was using CSS variables for text color that might not have been properly resolved
2. **Tailwind Class Conflicts**: Text color utility classes weren't being applied with sufficient specificity
3. **Missing Explicit Text Colors**: Some components relied on inherited colors that weren't properly set

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Global CSS Fixes (`src/index.css`)

#### Direct Color Values
- Replaced CSS variables with direct color values for better reliability:
```css
body {
  color: #171717; /* Direct value instead of var(--color-dark) */
  background: #ffffff; /* Direct value instead of var(--color-light) */
}
```

#### Text Color Utility Overrides
- Added `!important` declarations for all Tailwind text color utilities:
```css
.text-gray-900 { color: #111827 !important; }
.text-gray-800 { color: #1f2937 !important; }
.text-gray-700 { color: #374151 !important; }
.text-gray-600 { color: #4b5563 !important; }
.text-black { color: #000000 !important; }
/* ... and more */
```

#### Component-Specific Fixes
- Added `.enrollment-modal` class with forced text colors
- Added `.component-text-fix` utility class for problematic components
- Added background-specific text color inheritance rules

### 2. Component Updates

#### Enrollment Modal
- Added `enrollment-modal` class to the main modal container
- Added `component-text-fix` class to PaymentStep and PricingStep components

#### Global Text Inheritance
- Ensured all elements inherit proper text colors from their parents
- Added specific rules for white/light backgrounds to force dark text

### 3. Development Tools

#### Debug Utility (`src/utils/textVisibilityDebug.ts`)
Created comprehensive debugging tools available in development mode:

```javascript
// Available in browser console during development:
debugTextVisibility()      // Analyze text visibility issues
autoFixTextVisibility()    // Auto-fix common problems
highlightTextIssues(true)  // Visually highlight problematic elements
```

#### Test Page
Created `src/components/enrollment/test-text-visibility.html` to verify fixes work correctly.

### 4. CSS Specificity Strategy

Used a layered approach to ensure text visibility:

1. **Base Layer**: Set default dark text on body
2. **Utility Layer**: Override Tailwind classes with `!important`
3. **Component Layer**: Specific fixes for modal and form components
4. **Background Layer**: Ensure light backgrounds have dark text

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open the enrollment modal
2. Check that all text is clearly visible
3. Verify payment step text is readable
4. Confirm pricing step text is visible

### Development Testing
1. Open browser console
2. Run `debugTextVisibility()` to check for issues
3. Use `highlightTextIssues(true)` to visually identify problems
4. Run `autoFixTextVisibility()` to apply automatic fixes

### Test Cases Covered
- ✅ Modal headers and titles
- ✅ Form labels and inputs
- ✅ Button text (both primary and secondary)
- ✅ Plan descriptions and pricing
- ✅ Error messages and notifications
- ✅ Helper text and instructions

## Browser Compatibility
These fixes work across all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Only adds a few CSS rules
- No JavaScript performance impact
- Debug tools only load in development mode

## Future Maintenance

### Best Practices
1. Always use explicit text color classes (`text-gray-900`, `text-black`, etc.)
2. Test text visibility on both light and dark backgrounds
3. Use the debug tools during development to catch issues early

### Common Patterns to Avoid
```css
/* Avoid relying on inheritance without explicit colors */
.my-component {
  /* Missing: color: #111827; */
}

/* Avoid CSS variables for critical text colors */
.my-text {
  color: var(--some-variable); /* Use direct values instead */
}
```

### Recommended Patterns
```css
/* Always be explicit about text colors */
.my-component {
  color: #111827;
}

/* Use Tailwind utilities consistently */
<div className="text-gray-900">
  <h2 className="text-gray-900">Title</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-600">Description</p>
</div>
```

## Rollback Plan
If these fixes cause issues, you can:

1. Remove the `!important` declarations from text color utilities
2. Remove the `.enrollment-modal` and `.component-text-fix` classes
3. Revert to CSS variables in the body selector
4. Remove the debug utility import from App.tsx
