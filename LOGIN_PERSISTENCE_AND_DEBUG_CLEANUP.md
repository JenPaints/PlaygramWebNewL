# Login Persistence & Debug Cleanup - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Persistence Issue
**Problem**: Android app was continuously asking for login when app was closed and reopened.

**Solution**: Implemented 7-day session expiration with proper timestamp tracking.

#### Changes Made:
- **AuthContext.tsx**: Added session timestamp management
  - Sessions now expire after 7 days (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ms)
  - Added `playgram_session_timestamp` to localStorage
  - Session validation on app startup
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
  - Timestamp updates on login and user data refresh

#### Key Features:
- **7-day validity**: Login stays valid for exactly 7 days
- **Automatic expiration**: Old sessions are automatically cleared
- **Backward compatibility**: Handles old sessions without timestamps
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted session data

### 2. Debug Information Cleanup
**Problem**: CoachingView was showing debug information in production.

**Solution**: Removed all debug logging and UI elements.

#### Changes Made:
- **CoachingView.tsx**: 
  - Removed debug information panel
  - Removed console.log statements
  - Cleaned up debug useEffect hooks

- **MobileApp.tsx**:
  - Removed debug logging useEffect
  - Removed test data creation code
  - Cleaned up unused imports and variables

## Technical Implementation

### Session Management Flow:
1. **Login**: Set user data + timestamp in localStorage
2. **App Startup**: Check if session exists and is valid (< 7 days old)
3. **Expiration**: Clear session data if older than 7 days
4. **Refresh**: Update timestamp when user data is refreshed
5. **Logout**: Clear all session data including timestamp

### Storage Keys:
- `playgram_user`: User data (existing)
- `playgram_session_timestamp`: Session creation/update time (new)
- `aisensy_otp_sessions`: OTP session data (existing)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Persistence**:
   - Login to the app
   - Close and reopen the app multiple times
   - Verify user stays logged in
   - Test after 7+ days to ensure automatic logout

2. **Debug Cleanup**:
   - Navigate to CoachingView
   - Verify no debug information is displayed
   - Check browser console for reduced debug logs

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Added session expiration logic
   - Enhanced localStorage management

2. `src/components/dashboard/views/CoachingView.tsx`
   - Removed debug UI components
   - Cleaned up debug logging

3. `src/components/mobile/MobileApp.tsx`
   - Removed debug logging
   - Cleaned up test data creation code

## Build & Deployment

- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
- ✅ Android sync complete: `npx cap sync android`
- ✅ Ready for testing and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Test the app on Android device
2. Verify login persistence works correctly
3. Confirm debug information is no longer visible
4. Deploy to production if tests pass

The app should now maintain login sessions for 7 days and display a clean, production-ready interface without debug information.
