# ðŸ”§ Payment Tracking Fix - Admin Dashboard

## Issue Identified
The payment tracking system in the admin dashboard wasn't showing payment details for:
- âœ… Merchandise purchases 
- âœ… Sport enrollments

## Root Cause
The payment tracking system was creating payment records with 'pending' status, but when payments were completed successfully, the payment status in the unified payments table was not being updated to 'completed' in all cases.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Payment Verification Function
Updated `convex/payments.ts` - `verifyPaymentAndCreateEnrollment` function to:
- âœ… Create enrollment record properly
- âœ… Update payment status to 'completed' when payment succeeds
- âœ… Link payment record with enrollment ID
- âœ… Add proper error handling and logging

### 2. Verified Merchandise Payment Tracking
Confirmed that `convex/merchandiseOrders.ts` - `updateOrderPayment` function:
- âœ… Already correctly updates payments table status
- âœ… Sets status to 'completed' when payment is 'paid'
- âœ… Sets status to 'failed' when payment fails
- âœ… Includes proper error handling

## How Payment Tracking Works Now

### For Sport Enrollments:
1. **Order Creation**: Payment record created with 'pending' status
2. **Payment Success**: `verifyPaymentAndCreateEnrollment` called
3. **Status Update**: Payment status updated to 'completed'
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Shows completed payment with all details

### For Merchandise Orders:
1. **Order Creation**: Payment record created with 'pending' status
2. **Payment Success**: `updateOrderPayment` called with 'paid' status
3. **Status Update**: Payment status updated to 'completed'
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Shows completed payment with all details

## Testing the Fix

### To Test Sport Enrollment Tracking:
1. Go to any sport page (e.g., Football)
2. Select a plan and complete enrollment
3. Make a test payment
4. Check Admin Dashboard > Payment Tracking

### To Test Merchandise Tracking:

## Expected Results

âœ… **All completed merchandise purchases** with order details  
âœ… **Proper payment status tracking** (pending â†’ completed)
âœ… **User information** linked to payments

## Verification Steps

## Troubleshooting

If payments still don't appear:

3. **Check Payment Flow**: Ensure payment success handlers are called
4. **Database Check**: Verify payments table has records with correct status

## Next Steps
